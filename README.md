This is my attempt to experiment with awesome PICO-8 game engine. In their own words:

PICO-8 is a fantasy console for making, sharing and playing tiny games and other computer programs. When you turn it on, the machine greets you with a shell for typing in Lua commands and provides simple built-in tools for creating your own cartridges.


### How to run it ?
Import fruitomania.p8 into your PICO-8 emulator. 

### I want a binary distribution !
Reach out to me in case you want a standalone runnable artifact like .html/js, or a Linux/Windows binary.
